I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [Hunan Normal University](https://www.hunnu.edu.cn/). I am majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology, with a focus on Big Data Statistics.So my research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

During my university years, I participated in two significant research projects. 
One is "Aurora Technology - AI-based Identification and Analysis System for Traditional Chinese Medicine Using a Portable MEMS Spectrometer," where I was responsible for the Android development of the system. 
The other is "Research on Real-time Interactive Visualization Technology of 3D Boundary Element Data," a national-level project, where we developed a visualization interface between the 3D Boundary Element Algorithm and Paraview. I was the primary leader of the project, which is now nearing completion.

As I approach my undergraduate graduation, I have been recommended for direct admission to the [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) School of Medicine, with a focus on Bioinformatics, based on my comprehensive first-place ranking in my major. I hope to shine in this new field and contribute my efforts.

That's all.
