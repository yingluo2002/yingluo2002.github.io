## **Introduction**

Here, you can learn about my academic journey in this world.

I graduated from the School of Mathematics and Statistics at [Hunan Normal University](https://www.hunnu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree, under the guidance of Professor [Bo Yang](https://gsy.hunnu.edu.cn/info/1071/2383.htm) and Professor [Bo Wang](https://mc.hunnu.edu.cn/info/1665/4957.htm).

My master's degree is about to go to Zhongshan Medical College, [Sun Yat sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), majoring in bioinformatics. I will be studying under Professor [Miaoxin Li](https://zssom.sysu.edu.cn/zh-hans/teacher/472), and you can find detailed information about our research group [here](http://pmglab.top/).
